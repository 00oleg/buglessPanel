Bugless Panel
==================

**Bugless Panel** is a **JavaScript library** used to create **side menu** panels on mobile web sites, 
which can be opened by a swipe on the screen, or by click on a hamburger menu button for example.
It is written on pure JavaScript and doesn't require any third party libraries like jQuery, 
all what you need to do is to connect the JavaScript and CSS file to your project, and to initialize the panel.
As result you will get cool side menu panels, which are **cross browser** and **cross platform**.
Bugless Panel was tested, and it runs perfect on such devices, OS and browsers like:

* iPhone 5s / iPhone 6 / iPad devices with iOS and Safari or Chrome browsers;
* Samsung Galaxy S5;
* Samsung S6 Edge;
* LG Nexus 4;
* And other android devices with Chrome browser;
